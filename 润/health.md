Health insurance is a requirement for all enrolled students

All students are automatically enrolled into the university plan and charged the student health insurance fee

The student health insurance fee will be placed on your student account the moment that the term starts

The university plan provides several benefits including competitive premiums(保费), low deductibles(免赔额), prescription drug coverage, mental health services, 24/7 tele-health services, and a nationwide provider network

For international students who plan to arrive to campus early, you will have the option to purchase up to 30 days of pre-arrival insurance coverage before the start of the semester
