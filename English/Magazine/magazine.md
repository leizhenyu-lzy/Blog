## 20240109 Mandarin - 满大人？

英文 Mandarin (中国国语/官话/普通话/华语) 源自葡文 Mandarim ，而葡文 Mandarim 源自马来文 menteri (朝臣、部长)，而马来文 menteri 又源自梵文 mantrin (部长)

Mandarin 绝非甚么「满大人」的音译，当时满洲人尚未入关，中原还是大明的天下，而且当时满洲族仍称女真族，满洲族之名是皇太极改后金国号为清时一并改的

十六世纪末至十七世纪初的来华传教士利玛窦就用 Mandarim 的拉丁文转写 Mandarinos 来称呼明朝的官员，尤其是与他交好的士大夫

Mandarim在清初时有了引申义：由单纯指中国官员，变成兼指中国官员所说的语言，即中国官话。后来引申义变得比原义更通用。

## 20240103 It's harder to save money than it was in the past

In my opinion, saving money has indeed become more challenging compared to the past. And there are several factors contributing to this issue.

Firstly, the cost of living has significantly increased over the past decade. Housing, eduction, healthcare are all becoming more and more expensive and you can not


 really save money in these areas. It seems that the inflation is always faster than the increase of your income.

Secondly, nowadays people are constantly exposed to new products and services on the Internet. When you are surfing on TikTok or simply reading an article, you will inevitably see a lot of ads which will trigger your desire to buy stuff that you do not actually need.

In conclusion, it is much harder to save money in the modern era.

Collins Dictionary has named "AI" as its word of the year, defining it as an "abbreviation for artificial intelligence: the modelling of human mental functions by computer programs."

"Considered to be the next great technological revolution, AI has seen rapid development and has been much talked about in 2023," the UK-based dictionary publisher said in a statement announcing its decision.

If computers were suddenly experts in that most human of domains, language, what next?

We know that AI has been a big focus this year in the way that it has developed and has quickly become as **ubiquitous**(无所不在) and **embedded in our lives** as email, streaming or any other once futuristic, now everyday technology.

**Nepotism**(裙带关系) is the unfair use of power in order to get jobs or other benefits for your family or friends.
