Generative AI Uses
1. Image Generation
2. Video Synthesis
3. Language Generation
4. Music Composition

designed to generate new content

GAN
1. generator - create images
2. evaluator - give feedback to the generator how to improve
3. input & output are same type of data

VAE(variational auto-encoder)
1. anomaly(异常) detection
2. training a model on a dataset of normal data, then using the model to identify instances that deviate from normal data
3. Uses
   1. financial transactions fraud (Uber)
   2. manufacturing flaws
   3. network security breaches/intrusion (Google)
   4. industrial quality control (defects in products : scratches/dents/misalignments)
   5. healthcare (medical imaging)

4D : dirty, dull, dangerous, difficult

the top moral and executive skill sets required when working with generative AI
